# NOTE 1
This project was made by using Unity's 2D Game Kit and all the credits goes to the original creators as mentioned in the credits page in the game's option menu. I just designed some levels for educational purposes. I do NOT monetize this project by any means nor it is intended to infringe any copyright. I hold no rights to the project files. Unity's Game Kit is available for free for people to use and learn from it and it is exactly what is my intention.
